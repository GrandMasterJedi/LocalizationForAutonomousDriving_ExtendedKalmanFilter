# Extended Kalman Filter For Vehicle Localization 

The Kalman Filter estimate the position and velocity of a moving vehicle from an origin based on simulated lidar and radar measurement. Coordinates are expressed as Cartesian. 

Output of the estimation based on the two simulated dataset are as the following, with the green dots reppresenting estimated location.

The project is my solution to term 2.1 of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program. Check the original project repository for more information. 


## Project Resources

* This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)
* This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO.
